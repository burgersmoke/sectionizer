Ultrasound [**5-30**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Dilated common bile duct with 
mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and dilataion of the 
pancreatic duct. 2. Edematous gallbladder wall.

ERCP [**5-31**]: There was bulging of the major pailla suggestive of an 
impacted stone. A stone causing partial obstruction was seen in 
the distal CBD. 
There was dilation of the CBD above the stone however accurate 
radiographic evaluation could not be obtained due to the use of 
the C-arm in the ICU. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 
o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing 
guidewire. A 15mm balloon was used to sweep the duct multiple 
times wich successfully extracted stones, sludge and a large 
amount of purulent material. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2004**] was admitted on [**2573-5-30**]. Ultrasound at the time of 
admission demonstrated pancreatic duct dilitation and an 
edematous gallbladder. She was admitted to the ICU. [**5-31**] she 
underwent ERCP w/ sphincterotomy, an impacted stone was removed. 
She has had a prolonged ICU course. Review of hospital course by 
system includes.
Neuro: Neurology was consutled on [**6-11**] for mental status 
changes. The team believed the patient's MS [**First Name (Titles) 1935**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2005**] from 
her overall metabolic and infectious  conditions. A head CT was 
performed which was negative. A lumbar puncture was also done 
which too was negative. 

Cardiovascular: The cardiology team was consulted on [**6-1**] and a 
TTE was obtained showing decreased biventricular systolic 
dysfunction representing a diffuse process. On [**6-14**] a repeat TTE 
followed by a TEE was done to rule out endocarditis; no 
vegatation or abscess was seen. A TEE was again performed on 
[**6-22**] there was no significant change from the prior study. The 
patient was treated with amiodarone to control her atrial 
fibrillation. 

Pulmonary: Patient was intubated on admission and transferred to 
the ICU. Patient was initially extubated on hospital day six. 
The patient was re-intubated on [**6-12**] for hypercarbic respiratory 
failure and airway protection. The patient was extubated again 
on [**6-18**] and re-intubated on [**6-19**] for respiratory decompensation. 
The patient ultimately underwent a tracheostomy on [**6-24**]. The 
patient tolerated a trach mask on [**6-25**]. Bronchoscopy on [**6-26**] 
with suctioning of bronchial plugs. CT chest on [**6-27**] showed 
collapse of the left lung with left sided pleural effusion. Left 
sided thoracentesis was done on [**6-27**] to remove fluid with hope 
of re-expanding left lung.

GI: Patient was admitted with a diagnosis of gallstone 
pancreatitis, she underwent ERCP w/ sphincterotomy on [**5-31**]. Her 
tube feeds were started due anticipation of a  prolonged period 
without orally based enteral nutrition. [**6-9**] patient had a CT 
scan of the abdomen,it showed no gallstones or abscess. A 
post-pyloric dobhoff was placed on [**6-14**]. The patient's caloric 
intake was maintained by a combination of TPN and tube feeds. 
Each nutritional replacment was employed at different times 
independently of the other based on the patient's tolerance for 
tube feeds or TPN.

FEN: Patient was dehydrated, with hypovolemia and treated with 
aggressive fluid hydration upon admission to the hospital. Tube 
feeds were held on [**6-30**] due to high residuals. Currently the 
patient is not on TPN, while nutrition more recently has been 
maintained with tube feeds.

Renal: Foley in place to monitor urine output.

Heme: Blood loss and anemia in the unit requiring multiple 
transfusions. Currently, hematocrit is stable.

ID: Consult was obtained on [**6-12**] the ID team continued to follow 
the patient throughout her entire hospital stay. The patient had 
multiple episodes of fever and cultures which were positive for 
the following organisms. [**6-26**] Blood: MRSA // [**6-23**] Sputum: MRSA, 
Klebsiella // [**6-22**] Sputum: MRSA, Klebsiella // 23: Bld/Tip- pend

PNEUMONIAE, Corynybacterium 
Additionally the patient had multiple line changes secondary to 
spiking temperatures and positive cultures.The patient was 
treated with multiple antibiotics during her hospital course and 
at the time of discharge he was being treated with Ambisome, 
Caspofungin and Vancomycin. Please continue Ambisome and 
caspofungin until [**7-6**], Vancomycin should be continued until 
[**7-12**].

Endo: The patient has been maintained on an insulin sliding 
scale through the duration of her hospital course.

Consults: The team orderd a pysch consult on the patient on [**6-7**] 
becuse the patient appeared to be confused. An opthomology 
consult was ordered to rule out fungally related eye infection. 
The patient was seen and evaluated by optho; they deemed that 
there was no eye infection.
